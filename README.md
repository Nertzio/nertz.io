# NertzIO: Play Nertz In Real-Time Online

NertzIO is a web app version of the fast-paced, real-time multiplayer card game, Nertz, a hybrid of Solitaire and Speed. It is a competitive game for four players using a pack of cards for each player. The players race to play the most cards in the field before someone depletes their Nertz pile.

If you've never played Nertz before, you should read up game mechanics [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nertz) and check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iem-5SUCC8Q), and [this one too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvca2HKMW0c&t=194s).

The real-time user experience of this app is achieved utilizing [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as core technologies.
